With this option selected, switching to the next wizard page enables you to specify the settings of a target virtual machine instance.

First, you need to select an existing Azure account or create and configure a new one.

After you selected an account, specify the following options:

* Computer name
* **Location**  
  Specifies the virtual machine's location.  
  Azure operates in multiple data centers around the world that are grouped into geographic regions, giving you flexibility in choosing where to build your applications. See [Regions and availability for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/regions-and-availability) to learn how and where your virtual machines operate in Azure, along with your options to maximize performance, availability, and redundancy.

* **Resource group**  
  Specifies the container that holds related _resources_ \(such as virtual machines, storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks\) for an Azure solution. See [Resource groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview#resource-groups) for more information.
