### Restore to Amazon EC2 Instance

This option enables you to restore your disk image to an [Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) of your choice.

This feature is supported for the following operation systems:

* Windows Server 2008
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2016

With this option selected, switching to the next wizard page enables you to specify the settings of a target EC2 instance.

First, you need to select an existing, or specify a new _"S3"_ or _"S3 China"_ instance account.

_**\[See the following article to learn how to add a new S3 account to CloudBerry Backup.\]**_

_**\[Please make sure that the specified account has all required permissions.\]**_

_**\[Are the following settings required?\]**_

After selecting an account, specify the main settings of a target instance:

#### **Region**

_**\[What happens with a plan after migrating an instance to another Availability Zone?\]**_

* #### **Instance type**

  Amazon EC2 provides a wide selection of instance types optimized to fit different use cases, such as computing, memory use, accelerated computing and optimized storage.

  > See[Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://www.gitbook.com/book/yuriyshutov/restore-wizard-draft/edit#)learn about the available instance types.

* #### **Subnet**

  A virtual private cloud \(VPC\) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC.

  > A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region.
  >
  > After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone.
  >
  > See[VPCs and Subnets](https://www.gitbook.com/book/yuriyshutov/restore-wizard-draft/edit#)for more information[.](https://www.gitbook.com/book/yuriyshutov/restore-wizard-draft/edit#)

* #### **Security group**

  AWS enables you to increase security in your VPC by using the following features:

  * **Security groups**act as a firewall for associated Amazon EC2 instances, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

  * **Network access control lists \(ACLs\)**act as a firewall for associated subnets, controlling both inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

  While you are more likely to use security groups, you can also use network ACLs if you want an additional layer of security for your VPC.

  > When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can associate one or more security groups that you've created. Each instance in your VPC could belong to a different set of security groups. If you don't specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance automatically belongs to the default security group for the VPC.
