## 3.1.2.3.3 - Restore to Elastic Block Store \(EBS\) Volume

Amazon EBS provides raw storage – just like a hard disk – which you can attach to your EC2 instances. Once attached, you create a file system and get immediate access to your storage. You can create EBS General Purpose \(SSD\) and Provisioned IOPS \(SSD\) volumes up to **16** TB in size, and slower, legacy magnetic volumes.
