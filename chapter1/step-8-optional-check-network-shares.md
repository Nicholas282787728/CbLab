## Step 8 \(Optional\) - Check Network Shares

If you specified one or more network locations on previous wizard pages, you can make the Restore Wizard check whether it will be able to access these locations.

When the corresponding option is enabled on this page, the wizard will not allow you to switch to the next page unless you have specified credentials for accessing all network shares. To specify the credentials, click the **No** link indicating that no credentials were defined for a specific network share.

This invokes the **Add/Edit Network Path** dialog where you can specify the credentials and click **Test** to ensure that they are valid.
