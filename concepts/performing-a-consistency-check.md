\[add cross-links to the Sync topic, and maybe "File tree troubleshooting"\]

sync is one-way

cons.check is two-way, history will list not found \(warning\) and added files \(green files\)

this list -&gt; history filter by files



..

sync kills and creates \(re init\)

..

if \(file name encr\){

specify password before cons.check 

}

else {

files wuill be skipped}

..

can be scheduled \(unlike the sync\)

e.g. when push from different machines in a same prefix

..

c.c. cannot be executed during backup to this account occurs \(warning will be seen\)

..

c.c. performed one by one \(not simultaneously\)

..
