## Microsoft Exchange - Restoring Databases

CloudBerry Backup enables you to back up and restore [Microsoft Exchange](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/) data.

> Microsoft Exchange versions 2010, 2013 and 2016 are supported.

To restore Microsoft Exchange data from a backup, switch to the **Home** tab of the CloudBerry Backup main menu and click **Restore**.

Because Microsoft Exchange databases are composed of files \(such as EDB files and transaction logs\), you need to select the "**Restore files and folders**" option on the corresponding Restore Wizard page.

> Item-level restore is available for Microsoft Exchange 2010, and instead of restoring an entire Exchange database you can restore individual files, such as specific emails and contact data. See [Item-Level Restore](/concepts/microsoft-exchange-item-level-restore.md) for more information.
