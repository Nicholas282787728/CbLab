## Microsoft Exchange - Restoring Databases

CloudBerry Backup enables you to back up and restore [Microsoft Exchange](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/) data.

> Microsoft Exchange versions 2007, 2010, 2013 and 2016 are supported.

To restore Microsoft Exchange data from a backup, switch to the **Home** tab of the CloudBerry Backup main menu and click **Restore**.

Because Microsoft Exchange databases are composed of files \(such as EDB files and transaction logs\), you need to select the "**Restore files and folders**" option on the corresponding Restore Wizard page.

> With Microsoft Exchange 2010, CloudBerry Backup enables you to access individual items in an Exchange Server database so that you can locate and view specific emails, contact data and other information in your backups. See [Item-Level Restore](/concepts/microsoft-exchange-item-level-restore.md) for more information.
