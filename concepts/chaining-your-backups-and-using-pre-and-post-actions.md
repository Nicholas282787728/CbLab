### Chaining Your Backups and Using Pre- And Post Actions

You can make the Backup Wizard automatically trigger the execution of another backup or restore plan after finishing the current backup task.

After enabling the "Backup chain" option, you can select a plan to execute and choose among the following two options:





Next, specify the optional pre- and post-actions. These are essentially scripts that can be executed prior to and immediately following backup. For instance, you can run a script that turns off the computer when the backup plan completes executing. Alternatively, you can run a script that, say, disables all incoming connections during the plan execution. Backup chain allows you to automatically trigger another backup plan when the current one completes.
