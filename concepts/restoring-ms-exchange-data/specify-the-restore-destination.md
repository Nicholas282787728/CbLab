CloudBerry Backup cannot restore Microsoft Exchange data directly to the database. After restoring the files, you will need to dismount a corresponding Exchange database, manually replace the required files with their restored versions and mount the database back on the server. See [Update the Exchange Server Database ](/concepts/microsoft-exchange-item-level-restore/update-the-exchange-server-database.md)for more information.
