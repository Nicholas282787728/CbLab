This tutorial illustrates how to use the Backup Wizard for backing up your files with a Windows version of CloudBerry Backup. This wizard enables you to save and re-use the configured backup plans.

> We do not recommend that you use file-level backup to back up your entire storage device. Use the image-based backup instead.

**\[Why?\]**

After launching CloudBerry Backup, you can run the Backup Wizard by pressing **Ctrl+B **or clicking **Files **on the **Home **tab of the application's main toolbar.
