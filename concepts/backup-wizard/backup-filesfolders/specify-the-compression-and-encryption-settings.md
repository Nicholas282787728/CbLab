On this wizard page, you can choose whether to compress and/or encrypt files in your backup.

You can make CloudBerry Backup compress your backup contents to decrease the space required for storing the backup and the time needed to upload it to the target storage.

In addition, you can protect your backup by encrypting its contents, file names, or both. CloudBerry Backup supports AES encryption with key sizes of **128**, **192** and **256** bits.

The more the key size, the stronger the encryption \(with more time required for processing your backup\). See the following article to learn more about the AES encryption: [Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).
