## Select the Backup Mode

> This page is not available when choosing **Hybrid Backup** or enabling Ransomware Protection on the [first wizard page](/concepts/backup-wizard/backup-filesfolders/welcome.md). In these cases, you need to specify the advanced options on the [next wizard page](/concepts/backup-wizard/backup-filesfolders/shared-specify-the-advanced-options.md).

On this page, you can select how your backup routine should be executed by choosing any of the following backup modes:

* **Advanced Mode**
  This is the default mode that provides maximum flexibility in terms of the available settings.  
  On the downside, you will not be able to access individual files in your backup using conventional file management tools, because a backup will be stored as a single solid object.  
  **\[Is that correct? Any workarounds for accessing such files?\]**

* **Simple Mode**
  This mode does not support encryption, block-level backup and custom retention policy.  
  However, you will be able to access individual files in such a backup using any file manager.  

* **Custom Mode**
  test

* **Archive Mode**
  With this mode selected, the backup service combines all these files into a single archive. This enables you to reduce the number of requests sent to the cloud storage when your backup contains a lot of small files.  

After you selected the required mode, proceed to the [next wizard page](/concepts/backup-wizard/backup-filesfolders/shared-specify-the-advanced-options.md) to specify additional settings for your backup plan.
